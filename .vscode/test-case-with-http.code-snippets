	// Place your naf workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Describe integration test suite": {
		"scope": "python",
		"prefix": "HTTPTest",
		"body": [
			"from assertpy import assert_that",
			"from routes import TestCaseWithHTTP, Routes",
			"from http import client",
			"import json",
			"",
			"class ${1:suit_name}(TestCaseWithHTTP):",
			"  ${2:endpoint}URL = f\"{Routes.BASE_PATH}/${2:endpoint}\"",
			"",
			"  def test${3:case}(self):",
			"    \"\"\"${4:test__description}\"\"\"",
